        <p>
            Right now this site is just a skeleton - a monument to writer's block, if you will. The
            nav links in the upper right all work, except for the Map pages.  I don't have my
            general layout figured out so I can't nail down the boilerplate and copypasta those out
            just yet.

            If you're just getting into this page, start with <a href="strategy/roles">The Six Roles
            of Overwatch</a>, then look at how that idea shakes out in <a href="strategy/comps">
            Various Team Compositions</a>.
